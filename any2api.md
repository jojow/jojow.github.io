*Auto-generate containerized APIs for arbitrary executables*

The *any2api* framework lets you wrap arbitrary executables (scripts, Chef cookbooks, Juju charms, compiled programs, etc.) by auto-generating containerized and portable APIs. This is to ease integration and orchestration of different kinds of executables, e.g., to implement automated deployment processes on top of these executables.

See [any2api.org](http://any2api.org) for further details.
