title: New Website for any2api
---

Finally, it's here! The new website provides various background information (intro, use cases, architecture) and details on how to use the any2api framework.

The *any2api* framework lets you wrap arbitrary executables (scripts, Chef cookbooks, Juju charms, compiled programs, etc.) by auto-generating containerized and portable APIs. This is to ease integration and orchestration of different kinds of executables, e.g., to implement automated deployment processes on top of these executables.
