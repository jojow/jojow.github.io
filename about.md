*Streamlining Software Development and Operations (DevOps) based on Continuous Delivery, Cloud Computing, and Open Source*

I'm convinced that modern applications (mainly Web, mobile, and IoT, but not only those) must be developed and delivered with tight integration between developers and sysadmins/operations people (DevOps). Otherwise, applications cannot evolve quickly and stable enough to satisfy and react to growing and constantly changing requirements of diverse users, stakeholders, and environments. Tight DevOps collaboration must be achieved through highly automated, aligned, but agile processes. Therefore, my current work and research heavily focus on DevOps collaboration, integration, and automation to bridge the gap between dev and ops, considering both design time and runtime (including knowledge management, decision support, monitoring, and feedback loops).

Continuously integrating, testing, and deploying new iterations of an application is required to quickly deliver updates and new features through a *deployment pipeline*. Continuous delivery is therefore the technical enabler to implement DevOps automation. In addition, Cloud computing enables automated, on-demand provisioning and management of resources such as virtual servers through APIs. This includes public Cloud providers such as Amazon and Google as well as Cloud management frameworks such as OpenStack and Cloud Foundry to maintain private Cloud environments, considering different levels of abstraction (IaaS, PaaS, *aaS).

I'm a strong supporter of open-source software because it's a great and efficient way to collaborate and to make serious progress based on actually running code/prototypes. Beside many other reasons, transparency and quality is significantly improved. Therefore, I share and publish my work whenever possible on GitHub under an open-source license. To ease the usage and re-use of my work, I package it in a portable way, e.g., as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) module and/or [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container.

The majority of my current projects technically focus on Web applications and Web APIs (mainly REST). Consequently, most of my code and prototypes are based on scripting languages such as JavaScript and Web frameworks (Node.js and others).

Currently, I'm working as a researcher and PhD student at the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS), which is located at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.
